# Nightmare

An open-source, agile story tracker. The design is simple and to the
point, with a focus on getting stories in and then getting them done. A
unique pub-sub powered multi-user feature lets you collaborate with
remote team members without losing of who's talking about what.

I'm in the process of rethinking the structure of this app, and
Rails might not be the best approach. 

The core is open-source, mostly vanilla Rails, so it can be tweaked
however your team requires. The structure of the app is somewhat
experimental, dividing the model layer into models and records. This is
done to enhance the clarity of the design and speed up the test-design
cycle. There is also a plugin framework for extending things and sharing
them with the community.
