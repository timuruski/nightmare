# Nightmare

An open-source, agile story tracker. The design is simple and to the
point, with a focus on getting stories in and then getting them done. A
unique pub-sub powered multi-user feature lets you collaborate with
remote team members without losing of who's talking about what.

The core is open-source, mostly vanilla Rails, so it can be tweaked
however your team requires. There is also a plugin framework for
extending things and sharing them with the community.
